ELAINE: Boy, I'm in the mood for a cheeseburger. JERRY: No. We gotta go to the soup place. ELAINE: What soup place? GEORGE: Oh, there's a soup stand, Kramer's been going there. JERRY: He's always raving. I finally got a chance to go there the other day, and I tell you this, you will be stunned. ELAINE: Stunned by soup? JERRY: You can't eat this soup standing up, your knees buckle. ELAINE: Huh. All right. Come on. JERRY: There's only one caveat -- the guy who runs the place is a little temperamental, especially about the ordering procedure. He's secretly referred to as the Soup Nazi.
